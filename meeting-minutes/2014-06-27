            Not clear about the differentiation about Congress and Tetris
            Something like resource optimization is not in the scope of congress
            Generic condition-action policies are supported by Congress through datalog support. There is an open problem or reliability analysis and enforcement that is open, similarly as Gokul mentioned for efficiently
