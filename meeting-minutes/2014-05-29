      - need to review all the comments <<< Delayed because of time

    Huawei's design (Jeremy)

       - may be we need to add something like "selector" into the policy definition, e.g. for all VM's cpu consumption >90%

    any conflict issues with intel's thought https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/File:Re-scheduler-component.PNG
